Environment variables needed :
  export SYSTEMC=/systemc/directory
  export SYSTEMC_AMS=/systemc_ams/directory

A SOCLIB environment is necessary. If you don't have a proper installation of SOCLIB you can get one at this address : 
https://www.soclib.fr/

The files soclib.conf and soft_flags.conf should contain what the soclib-cc tool expects to compile this platform successfully.
You can change the line "repos= ..." to change where soclib will save intermediate compile files.
You will probably want change "arch = '..'" to specify what arch you're compiling on. 
Soclib needs it to find systemc and systemc-ams libs.

Once your environment is properly configured you will probably want type :
  make
  ./run.exe
